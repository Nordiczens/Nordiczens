    alt="Hey, I'm Zens!">

  <p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm just a 16-year-old developer from Denmark, turning ideas into life one day at a time.</p>

  <h2>Here's some of my projects!</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>ZenithRPC:</strong> I've taken Rich Presence and turned it into an art form. If you're curious, check it
      out on <a href="https://github.com/ZensDK/ZenithRPC">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>ZenithCycler:</strong> Want to experience seamless cycling? Take a look <a
        href="https://github.com/ZensDK/ZenithCycler">here</a> if you find this interresting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I Choose Repl?</h2>

  <p>While I like using vsc, I create most of my projects for Replit due to the possibility for free hosting with alternative websites. So you
    don't have to worry about paying for something to be hosted 24/7.</p>

  <h2>Primarily focus</h2>

  <p>Discord is my primary focus since I find it quite dull and boring for the most part. That's why I've decided to create multiple tools for discord and will keep creating them in the future</p>

  <h2>Join my discord</h2>

  <p>If you're ready for the future of discord utilization? Join my <a href="https://discord.gg/stWgVnBgHq">Discord community</a> and let's create a better version of discord together slowly but surely.</p>
